This guide was written for someone with little or no experience using Hugo or with (CSS/Javascript/HTML).  If you are experienced then go to the [quick start - TL;DR ](#quick).

### The Tools

To be able to make your own cusomtized landing pages quickly and easily you'll need to install minimum of two tools and then grab a copy of this guide's source respository to use as a starter. The absolute minimum tools you'll need to install are

{{< link url="https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/" text="Hugo" display="tab" >}}  - a static site Generator

{{< box btn-bar >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_Windows-64bit.zip" text="Hugo for Windows" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_macOS-64bit.zip" text="Hugo For Mac" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/" text="Hugo for Linux" display="window" >}}
{{< /box >}}

**--AND--**

{{< link url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="tab" >}} a text/IDE editor

The following button will take you to the Atom website and offer a download button for Atom for your operating system.  Install it as you would any application in your operating system

{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="window" >}}

Possibly the hardest part of building your custom landing page is getting these two tools installed!

### The Starter Site Code

Once you have Hugo and Atom installed you are ready to get a copy of the starter site.  Since this webpage you are reading was generated by Hugo with the same code/theme what better resource to use to get started than this guide itself!  So first decide on a directory in which to put it on your machine.  Then download the zip archive file using the button below.  Then extract it into that directory.  Then open that folder in Atom and you'll be ready to start editing your own landing page.
